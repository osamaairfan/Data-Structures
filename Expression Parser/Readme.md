# Expression Parser
>An expression parser is a program that takes a string representing an expression as input, and returns the result of evaluating that expression. The expression can be a simple arithmetic expression, such as "3 + 4", or it can be a more complex expression involving variables, function calls, and other elements.
>
>The process of parsing an expression typically involves breaking the input string down into its individual tokens (such as numbers, operators, and function names), and then using those tokens to build a representation of the expression in a form that can be easily evaluated.
>The way to write arithmetic expression is known as a notation. An arithmetic expression can be written in three different but equivalent notations, i.e., without changing >the essence or output of an expression. 
>
>These notations are:
>
>•	Infix Notation
>
>•	Prefix Notation
>
>•	Postfix Notation
>
>It is not a very efficient way to design an algorithm or program to parse infix notations because it is really complicated and less efficient. Instead, these infix notations are first converted into either postfix or prefix notations and then computed or evaluated.
>To parse any arithmetic expression, we need to take care of operator precedence and associativity also.
>
>Expression parsers are used in a wide variety of applications, including programming languages, scientific calculators, and spreadsheet software. They allow users to enter complex expressions and have them evaluated automatically, without the need to write custom code to process the expression.
